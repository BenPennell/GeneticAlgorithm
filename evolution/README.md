# Alright, here's the deal.

This is a project I did in free time after finishing my work in my grade 11 Computer Science class when I was 16.

This is a genetic algorithm that works, but is bad. Dots learn, via a genetic algorithm, how to navigate around a bar and reach a goal. If you want to run it, good luck, you need to use bluej. This code is bad.

The code I wrote was:
evolution.java
drone.java
vector.java

And I believe that you need to run evolution.java to start it.

The rest was from some package for drawing shapes for bluej that I cannot find anymore. Thank you to those folks for making this possible.
